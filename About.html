            Hi! My name is Drew Cook and I'm majoring in IT. I found my passion for technology in high <br>
            school after accidentally enrolling in a basic Python course. Un-thrilled at first, I quickly <br>
            found love for the field upon realizing all the opportunities it presents, as well as its <br>
            diversity and creativity. Technology is a tool to make thoughts become a reality, and I have a <br>
            desire to master that tool.

            &nbsp;Currently, I am a sophomore at Kennesaw State University pursuing a bachelorâ€™s degree in <br>
            &nbsp;information technology. Throughout my studies, I was invited to become a programming <br>
            &nbsp;tutor for the university, where I now assist students with Python, Java, and basic <br>
            &nbsp;computational thinking.

            &nbsp;In the classroom, I love working in team environments, seeing all the pieces of a project fit <br>
            &nbsp;together, and learning as much as I can! I also love the outdoors, hanging out with friends, <br>
            &nbsp;travelling, eating, and running! I ran my first marathon at the age of 19 and I have dreams of <br>
            &nbsp;running in some of the infamous National Parks around the country. In the future, I hope to <br>
            &nbsp;run fast enough to qualify for the Boston Marathon!
